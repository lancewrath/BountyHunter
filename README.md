## Bounty Hunter mod for SE
This is a Server side mod that adds NPC bounties randomly to Personal contract blocks on your ships and stations.
This mod has caused me to lose a few hairlines figuring out SE's contract custom system as well as managing contracts. But for the most part it is working.

How it works is you place a contract block on one of your grids, after a while as ships spawn in and what not bounties may come in for Characters that are spawned into those grids. The bounties are generally from Factions you don't have a negative reputation with.

Once the contract is accepted you are given an approximate GPS coordinate of the target (within 5km) .

When you damage the character itself they will randomly taunt you with insults, they will also say something when they die. Anyone within 3km of the kill who also had a bounty for the character should also get a completed bounty and reward. So yes multiple bounties from different factions can appear and multiple players and factions can get the same bounty so it is a race to kill the target before someone else.

This should theoretically work with MES though i haven't tried it yet.

Again this is early access beta. If you want to try it out and give me feedback its much appreciated.

This works offline for PC, For XBox it must be hosted on a dedicated server.

**Known Issues to Fix**

- **Main Issue** - SE Contract system not reactivating contracts when server restarts (not sure how to fix yet as the ModSDK lacks a lot of commands for handling contracts)
- Having troubles making a Spawned NPC sit in a chair or cockpit, (For now they just kind of stand by a ******* or seat)
- Some Characters Spawn in a safezone and have to be pushed outside to kill them lol.
- Probably more as people test this out.

**Things I want to add**

- Now that i have figured out the custom contract thing i want to add some adventure multi stage contracts to the game.
- Derelict Freighters which have maybe spiders in it that you have to fight etc. etc.
